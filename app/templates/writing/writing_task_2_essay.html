                        <p>Robert Kay's book is about communities in Britain who were moved from houses into so-called 'high-rise' accommodation. 'High-rise' means apartments in tall buildings with anything more than four floors, although many buildings had twenty or thirty floors. In the 1960s many people lived in small two-storey houses with poor heating and little plumbing. The authorities thought these houses were too crowded and old-fashioned for Britain's growing population.</p>
                        <p>The authorities expected them to be happier in blocks of apartments they called 'streets in the sky'. But many people disliked their new homes. The architects used concrete as it was easy to build with, but the public thought it made the buildings look dull. Residents missed their old neighbours, and they didn't get to know their new neighbours because the tower blocks had few shared areas to meet in. For the children, there were no gardens to play in. Many residents moved back into houses when they could afford it, and some less popular tower blocks were demolished in the 1990s.</p>

                        <p>We continue our series on Reimagining Home. Last month, we looked at co-housing communities and why more people are sharing their living space. This month, we ask a different question: can high-rise buildings feel like home?</p>
                        <p>A recent satisfaction survey revealed that, while high-rise apartments are seen as convenient and good value for money, they are still thought to be smaller, noisier, and less safe than houses.</p>
                        <p>A new project in Westchester City, England may start to change people's minds. The architects of 'Rose Park Towers' say that their development shows that high-rise living is moving away from the lonely grey concrete blocks of the past.</p>
                        <p>The buildings are certainly beautiful, with four ten-storey towers of rose-coloured glass offering wide views of the city. Neighbours can meet and relax in the rooftop gardens. The development also has its own supermarket, gym, two restaurants, and friendly security staff. Most residents here are happy with their accommodation, despite the surprisingly high price. As a luxury development, some Rose Parks apartments cost just as much as a house in the suburbs.</p>
                        <p>The government has praised the project for its ecological design and is now planning to use similar solutions which use solar energy and sustainable materials to other urban infrastructure.</p>
