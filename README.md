# Trinity College Language Assessment App

Welcome to the **Trinity College Language Assessment App**, a web-based platform designed to help candidates prepare for the ISE Digital Speaking, Writing, Reading, and Listening assessments. The app provides dynamic feedback for speaking and writing tasks using **OpenAI GPT-4** and **Whisper API** to process speech.

- **Writing Tasks:** Submit responses to various writing prompts and receive structured feedback.
- **Dynamic Feedback:** AI-generated feedback is displayed dynamically with suggestions on what candidates did well and where they could improve.
- **Multiple Questions:** Navigate through sequential speaking tasks.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Flask:** Backend web framework for handling routes and logic.
- **JavaScript:** Client-side interaction and audio recording logic.
- **OpenAI Whisper:** For transcribing speech responses.
- **OpenAI GPT-4:** For generating feedback.
- **Bootstrap:** For clean and responsive UI.
- **Heroku:** For deployment.
- **python-dotenv:** To manage environment variables securely.
